## Here Are some Test-Cases for the Roster-App

To test if the application is running go to the side "Add New Employee" (localhost:8080/add) and
add some information to every field. Then press the button "SAVE". The side will refresh after you
click on save so that every field is empty again. After that change to the side "List Of Employees"
(localhost:8080/list). The newly added "Employee" is listed here.

If you press the delete button of a choosen employee on the side "List Of Employees" this employee
will disappear from that side. 

Now go back to the "Add New Employee" side and add some information but do not fill the required field
"First Name". A "required" message under that field will appear and the underscore change to red. 
If you click the "SAVE" button - and not fill the "First Name" field the side will refresh again 
and your information are gone but the employee will not appear on the "List Of Employees" side because
the "First Name" field is set on required for the mongodb.
